## _ Default option to create multiple different output reports -----

## __ Produce a default html output with rmarkdown::render -----
rmarkdown::render(
  "2019-03-25 ReportCreationExample.R",
  output_file = "./output/ex_01_render_default.html"
)

## __ Produce a minimal html output with rmarkdown::render for comparison -----
rmarkdown::render(
  "2019-03-25 ReportCreationExample.R",
  output_format =  rmarkdown::html_document(
    theme = NULL, mathjax = NULL, highlight = NULL
  ),
  output_file = "./output/ex_02_render_minimalish.html"
)

## __ Produce html output with custom css, with external dependency ----
rmarkdown::render(
  "2019-03-25 ReportCreationExample.R",
  output_format =  rmarkdown::html_document(
    theme = NULL, mathjax = NULL, highlight = NULL,
    css = "./css/rmarkdown_spin_css_air.css"
  ),
  output_file = "./output/ex_03_render_air_css.html"
)
#==> This is again getting complicated

## __ other html_document themes -----
# see help file for full list of available themes
rmarkdown::render(
  "2019-03-25 ReportCreationExample.R",
  output_format =  rmarkdown::html_document(
    theme = "journal", mathjax = NULL, highlight = NULL
  ),
  output_file = "./output/ex_04_render_journal.html"
)

rmarkdown::render(
  "2019-03-25 ReportCreationExample.R",
  output_format =  rmarkdown::html_document(
    theme = "yeti", mathjax = NULL, highlight = NULL
  ),
  output_file = "./output/ex_05_render_yeti.html"
)

## _ Lightweight  option for html files with library prettydoc -----
# check help file for all available themes
rmarkdown::render(
  "2019-03-25 ReportCreationExample.R",
  output_format =  prettydoc::html_pretty(
    theme = "cayman"
  ),
  output_file = "./output/ex_07_render_cayman.html"
)

## _ Final piece of the puzzle: a snippet to almost automate it ----

snippet cayman
  rmarkdown::render(
  "${1:file.R}",
  output_format =  prettydoc::html_pretty(
    theme = "cayman"
  ),
  output_file = "./output/${1:file}.html"
  )
  
## Notes
# copy the above code to the snippets section in global options
# make sure that each line after the snippet line starts with a tab
# I use cayman as default theme, but you can change that based on code above
# also by default same name for html as the script file name
# but you can change that of course too.

# usage: type "cayman" in console, snippet will appear, type file name, enter

## Second option
snippet cayman
  rmarkdown::render(
    "`r 
    {list.files(pattern = "*.R") %>%
    file.info() %>%
    {bind_cols(FileName = row.names(.), .)} %>% 
    arrange(desc(atime)) %>% 
    pull(FileName) %>% 
    .[1]}
    `",
    output_format =  prettydoc::html_pretty(
      theme = "cayman"
    ),
    output_file = "./output/`r paste(sys.date(),
    {list.files(pattern = "*.R") %>%
    file.info() %>%
    {bind_cols(FileName = row.names(.), .)} %>% 
    arrange(desc(atime)) %>% 
    pull(FileName) %>% 
    .[1]}, sep = "_")
    `.html"
    )
  
  ## Notes
  # copy the above code to the snippets section in global options
  # make sure that each line after the snippet line starts with a tab
  # save the script file (OutputExample.R) as the last file in your folder that was saved,
# immediately after saving start typing cayman in the console
# tab-complete if necessary, and it will automatically load the last saved file as 
# the file to create the report from.
# It will also add a time stamp in front of the html file name
